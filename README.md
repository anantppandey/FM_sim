Introduction – The Project features a drivable model of the formula manipal’s race car in the         simulated real world enviroment of Gazebo. The project required creation of a gazebo model using the provided CAD model, adding the necessary sensors to it that can publish their outputs to appropriate ROS topics.
 

How to Use – There are two ways of accessing the simulation - 
    • Empty World - To run the simulation in an empty world.
        
                • roslaunch catvehicle FM_car.launch 
      
      Alternatively -
      
                • roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_empty.launch
                • roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_spawn.launch robot:=catvehicle X:=0 Y:=0 yaw:=1.5707963267
	
	Here the first command launces the empty world and the second one launches the vehicle

    • Acceleration Track - To run the simulation in an acceleration track.
        
                • roslaunch catvehicle fm_acceleration.launch
      
      Alternatively -
      
                • roslaunch eufs_gazebo acceleration.launch 
                • roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_spawn.launch robot:=catvehicle X:=-53

    • Skidpad Track - To run the simulation in an acceleration track.
        
                • roslaunch catvehicle fm_skidpad.launch
      
      Alternatively -
      
                • roslaunch eufs_gazebo skidpad.launch 
                • roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_spawn.launch robot:=catvehicle Y:=-14.4 yaw:=1.5707963267
                  
    • Controling the Vehicle – In order the steer the vehicle run the following commands -
                  
                • roslaunch  turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
                • rosrun topic_tools relay /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop /catvehicle/cmd_vel

 	After executing the second command you need to return to the terminal with the first 	command i.e. keyboard_teleop.launch in order to control the vehicle

P.s. -	The launch file does not seem to work in lower end laptops so the alternative methord is  	recommended.
     -	You need to increase the velocity in the turtlebot_teleop terminal with the “W” key first to a 	sufficient velocity for the vehicle to move
    -	The vehicle moves with the < U, I, O, J, K, L, M, ‘,’, ‘.’ > keys as explained the 	turtlebot_teleop_keyboard terminal.
